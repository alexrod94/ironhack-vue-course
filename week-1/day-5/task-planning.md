## Learning Goals

After this lesson you will be able to:

- Understand Software Development Methodologies
- Understand why Agile Methodologies are so important in contemporary development
- Understand Kanban is
- Use Trello to manage the Kanban methodology

## Introduction

Participating successfully in a software development team involves several factors: communication and coordination are two of the most important ones.
Lack of communication leads to less efficiency in development teams (i.e. two people could be doing the same task). **This is why it's important to have a good Project Management plan.** We do that by following Development Methodologies.

The Software Development Methodologies didn't emerge until 1960s. The [Systems Development Life Cycle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systems_development_life_cycle) can be considered the oldest formalized methodology for building information systems. It describes a process for planning, creating, testing, and deploying information systems.

It includes five phases you have to iterate over and over again to create your software. As you can imagine, it was very costly for the company to develop software with this methodology. You had to cover all the phases for each feature you implement in the product.

More methodologies appeared after this one: [Structured programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structured_programming), [Structured Systems Analysis and Design Method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structured_systems_analysis_and_design_method), [Waterfall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterfall_model), [Object Oriented Programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming), etc.

All the methodologies have their pros and cons, but nowadays one of the most used is [Agile](http://agilemethodology.org/).

## Agile

> We are uncovering better ways of developing software by doing it and helping others do it. Through this work we have come to value:
>
> - **Individuals and interactions** over processes and tools
> - **Working software** over comprehensive documentation
> - **Customer collaboration** over contract negotiation
> - **Responding to change** over following a plan
>
> That is, while there is value in the items on the right, we value the items on the left more.
>
> _[Agile Manifesto](http://agilemanifesto.org/), February 2001_
> The Agile Manifesto was created by seventeen people on **February 11-13, 2001**, in the Wasatch mountains of Utah. Representatives from Extreme Programming, SCRUM, DSDM, Adaptive Software Development, Crystal, Feature-Driven Development, Pragmatic Programming, and others sympathetic to the need for an alternative to documentation driven, heavyweight software development processes convened.

With this Manifesto, they agreed on [twelve principles](http://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html) to help teams respond to unpredictability through incremental, iterative work cadences and empirical feedback. Agilists propose alternatives to other methodologies like [Waterfall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterfall_model), or [traditional sequential development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traditional_engineering).

The Agile Methodology follows these [principles](http://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html):

- Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through **early and continuous delivery** of valuable software
- **Welcome changing requirements**, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the customer's competitive advantage.
- **Deliver working software frequently**, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale.
- Business people and developers must **work together daily** throughout the project.
- Build projects around **motivated individuals**. Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done.
- The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is **face-to-face conversation**.
- **Working software is the primary measure of progress.**
- Agile processes **promote sustainable development**. The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.
- Continuous attention to **technical excellence and good design** enhances agility.
- **Simplicity** --the art of maximizing the amount of work not done--is essential.
- The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from **self-organizing teams.**
- At regular intervals, the team **reflects on how to become more effective**, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly.

Agile seeks alternatives to traditional project management. Agile approaches help teams respond to unpredictability through incremental, iterative work cadences and empirical feedback.

The most common Agile methodologies are Scrum and Kanban. Scrum is the most popular way to introduce Agile due to its simplicity and flexibility. Kanban is more complete than Scrum, so we will learn Kanban.

## Kanban

The Kanban method is an approach to evolutionary process change for organizations. It uses visualization via a kanban board of intangible work items. The kanban board allows you to have a great understanding of both the work and the workflow.

![](https://i.imgur.com/N92i6QA.jpg)

As you can see in the image, the Kanban board has three different statuses:

- ToDo. Work that you have to do.
- Doing. Work that is in progress.
- Done. Work that is already done.

The kanban process is the following:

- The client requests a new feature
- You have to add the new request to your Kanban board, on the "ToDo" status
- Before start working on a new feature, you have to move the card to the "Doing" status
- Once the new feature is implemented and you have checked that it works, you must move the card to the "Done" status

The name of the status can be different depending on the development team. You can find the "Doing" status renamed as "On going", for example. The most important thing is to understand the workflow you have to follow to implement Kanban.

There are a lot of companies that have a white board to see the current status of a project. If you work on a distributed team, this is not the best solution. The members that are not in the office won't be able to move their cards. This is why you need some kind of tool to handle the Kanban board. We are going to use [Trello](http://www.trello.com).

## Trello

![](https://i.imgur.com/CxBGHUX.png =300x99)

Trello is a free tool you can use to create a Kanban board and manage all project tasks and features. It offers a visual board where you can create cards and drag and drop them through the different statuses they can have.

### Create an account

First of all you need to create a account. You can do it by following the green button in the home page. You just have to indicate your Name, Email, and Password and we are ready to go.

### Your first board

Once we have signed in, let's create a new board by clicking on "Create new board...". **The title for this board will be "My first Kanban board"**. It will look like this:

![](https://i.imgur.com/vGBi4ef.png)

Now, we are going to create three different lists, one per each status: ToDo, Doing, Done.

![](https://i.imgur.com/pxMutdN.png)

Finally, we are going to create three different cards, each one to represent different tasks:

- Signup in Trello
- Customize my Trello
- Change my board background color

We can create them all in the "ToDo" list, and then drag it to the status they should be. We should have something like this:

![](https://i.imgur.com/nFild1E.png)

As you can see we have finished the task "Signup in Trello", and we are doing the task of Customize our Trello board. Let's change the background color of our board. Before to do that, we have to move the card from "ToDo" to "Doing":

![](https://i.imgur.com/nSnpOlz.png)

To change the background color, we have to select the "Show Menu" option in the top right corner, and select the "Change background" option. Choose your favorite color to change the background color.

![](https://i.imgur.com/DaF7B2Z.png)

**We have changed our background color! Now we have to move the card to let our team know that it's done :)**

You can investigate other ways to customize your Trello board by your own. Once you are done, remember to move the card from "Doing" to "Done".

### Features

Trello has a lot of interesting features you should know:

- Add members. It allows you the option to add members to the board. Each member will be able to create cards and interact with them.
- Labels. You can assign different labels to the cards that will allow you to filter cards based on your criteria.
- Due date. It permits you to assign the date that the task should be finished.
- Checklist. You can create a checklist in a card to be able to track the percentage of things done.

### Trello Integration

Trello has a lot of integrations. You can integrate it with Slack to keep all the team updated when you move a card in the board. You also have a mobile version for iPhone, iPad, and Android, that gives you the possibility of checking out the status of the project from everywhere.

## Summary

To sum up, we have learned some history about software development methodologies. We can now understand why agile methodologies are so important nowadays and which problems they solve. We have seen that the most common agile methodologies are Scrum and Kanban, and we have learned Kanban in depth.

Finally, we have seen that Trello allows us to create our Kanban board digitally, so everybody in the company is able to see the status of the project.
