## HTML Semantic Elements

### What are Semantic Elements in HTML?

As opposed to non - semantic elements, in HTML semantic components are elements that have an inherent meaning that describe & define their content.

- Examples of non - semantic elements: `<div>` or `<span>`. These elements could include any kind of content and are very generic.
- Examples of semantic elements: `<footer>` or `<article>`. The tag itself gives us information about the kind of content it includes.

HTML introduced Semantic Elements in its latest versions, and their use is recommended whenever possible.
