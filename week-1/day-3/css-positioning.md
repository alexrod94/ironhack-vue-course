# CSS | Positioning -->

## Learning Goals

After this unit you will be able to...

- Position elements in the screen.
- Explain what float elements are and how to use them
- Clear floats and understand why it's important.

## Positioning

CSS gives us the ability to position and organize elements and content in multiple ways. The understanding of how we can position boxes in our layout is a key in making the content more digestible.

In this chapter weâ€™re going to take a look at a few different tools to position our elements nicely.

The `position` CSS property allows you to organize elements on the screen. Position can be:

- `static`
- `relative`
- `fixed`
- `absolute`

When setting the `position`, we can use the following properties:

- `top`
- `right`
- `bottom`
- `left`

Let's take a look at the possibilities.

### `position:static`

The initial or default value of an element is `static`. It means that the element is **not positioned** in any special way. It is displayed where it normally would be in the document.

- Elements with `position: static`, are described as **not positioned**.
- Elements with any other form of the `position` property are described as **positioned**.

### `position:relative`

A `relative` positioned element behaves the same as `static` unless you add some extra properties. You can adjust the position by setting the `top`, `left`, `right`, and `bottom` properties. It will move the element relative to where it would normally occur in the document. The other content will not be adjusted to fit into any gap left by the element.

To understand better the `position: relative` property, take a look to the following example:

<iframe height='224' scrolling='no' src='//codepen.io/ironhack/embed/JRoWwq/?height=224&theme-id=0&default-tab=result&embed-version=3' frameborder='no' allowtransparency='true' allowfullscreen='true' style='width: 100%;'></iframe>

### `position:fixed`

A fixed element is positioned relative to the screen of our device (computer, mobile, etc.). The element will always be in the same place, even if the page is scrolled. As with `relative`, the `top`, `left`, `right` and `bottom` properties are used.

Here you can see an example with the results of the `position: fixed` property:

<iframe height='400' scrolling='no' src='//codepen.io/ironhack/embed/qaEmWW/?height=400&theme-id=0&default-tab=result&embed-version=3' frameborder='no' allowtransparency='true' allowfullscreen='true' style='width: 100%;'></iframe>

### `position:absolute`

This is the most difficult position value to understand. Position `absolute` works as `fixed` but instead of being positioned relative to the viewport, it's positioned to the nearest positioned element in the DOM. This is, the nearest element with a `position` different than `static` set on the CSS.

If there's no ancestor positioned element in the document, it will use the document body and it still moves along with page scrolling.

Check out the following example to see something curious about this positioning:

<iframe height='250' scrolling='no' src='//codepen.io/ironhack/embed/GjgvjK/?height=250&theme-id=0&default-tab=result&embed-version=3' frameborder='no' allowtransparency='true' allowfullscreen='true' style='width: 100%;'></iframe>

As you can see, the there are two `<div>` one over the other. If you inspect the code below you can see that absolutely positioned page elements are removed from the flow of the page. It means that they don't affect the position of other elements, and the other elements will not affect them.

## Floats

Normally, the HTML elements follow a normal flow, placing one element under the other. The `float` property specifies that an element should be taken from the normal flow and placed along the **left** or **right** side of its container (its parent). The text and inline elements will wrap around it.

Float can take the following values:

- `left`. It indicates that the element must float on the left side of its containing block.
- `right`. It indicates that the element must float on the right side of its containing block.
- `none`. It indicates that the element must not float.
- `inherit`. It will assume the float value of the parent container of the element.

Note that floated elements remain a part of the flow of the web page, it's just that their position within the flow is altered. This is distinctly different than page elements that use absolute positioning.

### What are floats used for?

You can use floats for several things. You can wrap text around images or HTML elements by using it, as you can see here:

<iframe height='265' scrolling='no' src='//codepen.io/ironhack/embed/LREzRV/?height=265&theme-id=0&default-tab=result&embed-version=3' frameborder='no' allowtransparency='true' allowfullscreen='true' style='width: 100%;'></iframe>

But this is not the only application of the `float` property. You can use floats to create entire web layouts. For example, here you can see an small example with a normal web layout composed with floated elements:

<iframe height='265' scrolling='no' src='//codepen.io/ironhack/embed/vXEZmy/?height=265&theme-id=0&default-tab=result&embed-version=3' frameborder='no' allowtransparency='true' allowfullscreen='true' style='width: 100%;'></iframe>

Does it look familiar for you? Exactly! It's the Facebook layout! :)

### Clearing the floats

When we work with floats, sooner or later we will need to use the property `clear`. An element with the clear property on it will not move up adjacent to the float like the float desires, but will move itself down past the float. It will be easier to understand this with an example:

<iframe height='265' scrolling='no' src='//codepen.io/ironhack/embed/Gjgryv/?height=265&theme-id=0&default-tab=result&embed-version=3' frameborder='no' allowtransparency='true' allowfullscreen='true' style='width: 100%;'></iframe>

Try to remove the `clear` property from the `.footer` class an see what happens with the other elements. The sidebar is floated to the right and is shorter than the main content area. The footer then is required to jump up into the available space as is required by the float. The footer can be cleared to ensure it stays beneath both floated columns.

The `clear` property has four valid values:

- `left`. It clears the float from the left side.
- `right`. It clears the float from the right side.
- `both`. It clears floats coming from both directions.
- `none`. It's the default value. It's typically unnecessary unless you are removing an inherited clear value from cascade.

### Vertical Align

The vertical-align CSS property specifies the vertical alignment of an inline or table-cell box.

The vertical-align property can be used in two contexts:

- To vertically align an inline element's box inside its containing line box.

- To vertically align the content of a cell in a table

<iframe height='265' scrolling='no' title='ExampleEdit' src='//codepen.io/ironhack/embed/pryXpY/?height=265&theme-id=0&default-tab=html,result&embed-version=2' frameborder='no' allowtransparency='true' allowfullscreen='true' style='width: 100%;'>See the Pen <a href='https://codepen.io/ironhack/pen/pryXpY/'>ExampleEdit</a> by Ironhack (<a href='https://codepen.io/ironhack'>@ironhack</a>) on <a href='https://codepen.io'>CodePen</a>.

:memo: **Time to practice**

### The Newspaper Layout

Imagine you are working in a newspaper and the design team sends you the prototype of the new website. Your first task is to create the Homepage from this image:

![](https://i.imgur.com/c9EWb1a.jpg)

In the previous prototype you can easily identify these areas:

- header
- main nav
- main article
- several secondary articles

Use backgrounds and random content ([Lorem Ipsum](http://www.lipsum.com/) is a website where you can generate random content to put in your designs) to code this Homepage. Remember to use positioning to align your layout properly.

## Summary

You learned how we can position block elements all over the page. We have learned how to use the `top`, `right`, `bottom`, and `left` specifications in conjunction with properties such as margin, padding, and border to help you position and space elements.

Also, you learned what floated elements are and which problems can result from using them as well as how clearing the float elements in our HTML can help solve these problems.
