## Learning Goals

After this lesson, you will be able to:

- Understand what the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) are.
- Know what guidelines you need to implement on your web development projects in order to make them accessible.
- Understand what an accessible website is.

## Introduction: what's accessibility?

If you're going to create websites, you have to know what accessibility for websites means. Over the last years different organisms around the world have been putting a stronger emphasis on web accessibility for everyone. Nowadays, this topic is gaining more and more attention and importance.

On this lesson we're gonna cover what accessibility means and how you can make sure that the websites you create are accessible by following the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) recommendations.

During the last couple of years multiple companies and public entities started paying attention to the accessibility of the Internet. The world is focusing more and more on equal rights for everyone. In order to grant equal access opportunities to a website for everyone, there are some aspects that have to be considered while creating it.

The basic core concept of web accessibility is that not everybody has the same perceptive abilities. For example, some people are not able to properly perceive color, and others might need to operate their computer and browsing through voice and other tools that don't rely on visual cues.

Creating an accessible website means that we need to make sure that those people will be able to browse it as well as a person with traditional physical capabilities.

### How can you develop an accessible website?

There's basically two aspects to accessibility:

- One of them is how the website looks, meaning that any person has to be able to see and read it properly.
- The other aspect of it is how the website is developed. Some features like voice navigation have to be present in order for a website to be considered accessible.

There are many different aspects we can keep in mind while creating an accessible website. As of today, there are no official, universal guidelines; but the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) has created a series of guidelines, called the WCAG, that can be used as a sort of checklist in order to ensure a website is accessible.

## Introducing the WCAG Standards

The WCAG were first introduced on 1999 and focused exclusively on HTML. A few years later, on 2008, the 2.0 version of the guidelines was introduced, with a broader focus on other types of digital content such as Google Docs, spreadsheets, PDFs or eBooks.

The WCAG standards were created in an attempt to formulate a series of guidelines that helped web developers create more accessible websites. Although they give developers many different recommendations, they are structured around what's called the "Four Principles": perceivability, operability, understandability and robustness.

### 1- Perceivability

The first WCAG principle is perceivability. Websites need to provide several methods to consume a piece of information.

For example, videos should have subtitles, and pictures should include a descriptive alt text so speech softwares can give the user an accurate idea of their contents.

Another perceivability requirement is including enough contrast between colors, in order to allow people with visual difficulties to still understand the included information.

### 2- Operability

As per the WCAG principles, good websites and web apps should be accessible using only a keyboard. This means that, for example, there can't be any blocking elements that require the use of a mouse.

Besides that, the site's navigation has to be clear and help the user understand where each functionality is located.

### 3- Understandability

This principle refers to the fact that websites have to be understandable by people with any kind of perceptive abilities. Some important guidelines here are the following:

- Texts have to be readable and easily understandable.
- Websites need to operate in a predictable manner.
- Input fields have to offer assistance to users

### 4- Robustness

The last principle developed by the WCAG relates to the fact that websites have to be built in a way that still works even when taking into consideration how fast technology (like browsers and assisting software) evolve.

Websites must be accessible across different user agents, and remain accessible in the future.

## Summary

In this lesson, we've learned what accessibility means in web development, and why it's an important topic when creating a website.

We've also talked about the WCAG, the universal guidelines proposed by the W3C association to unify accessibility efforts all over the world.

Finally, we've taken a look at the "four principles" that are at the core of the W3C accessibility guidelines.

## Further reading

We've covered the basics of web accessibility here; but making a website open to everybody is a huge topic that requires a lot of theory and practice to truly master.
